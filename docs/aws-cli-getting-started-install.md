# Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI
<a name="getting-started-install"></a>

This topic describes how to install or update the latest release of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on supported operating systems. For information on the latest releases of AWS CLI, see the [AWS CLI version 2 Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst) on GitHub.

To install a past release of the AWS CLI, see [Installing past releases of the AWS CLI version 2](getting-started-version.md). For uninstall instructions, see [Uninstalling the AWS CLI version 2](uninstall.md).

**Important**  
AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same `aws` command name. If you previously installed AWS CLI version 1, see [Migration guide for the AWS CLI version 2](cliv2-migration.md).

## AWS CLI install and update instructions
<a name="getting-started-install-instructions"></a>

For installation and update instructions, expand the section for your operating system.

### Linux
<a name="install-linux"></a>

#### Install and update requirements
<a name="install-linux-prereqs"></a>
+ You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package. If your operating system doesn't have the built-in `unzip` command, use an equivalent.
+ The AWS CLI uses `glibc`, `groff`, and `less`. These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.
+ We support the AWS CLI on 64-bit versions of recent distributions of CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and Linux ARM.
+ Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories other than `snap`, we can’t guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.

#### Install or update the AWS CLI
<a name="install-linux-instructions"></a>

**Warning**  
If this is your first time updating on Amazon Linux, to install the latest version of the AWS CLI, you must uninstall the pre-installed `yum` version using the following command:  

```
$ sudo yum remove awscli
```
After the `yum` installation of the AWS CLI is removed, follow the below Linux install instructions.

You can install the AWS CLI by using one of the following methods:
+ **The command line installer** is good option for version control, as you can specify the version to install. This option does not auto-update and you must download a new installer each time you update to overwrite previous version.
+ **The officially supported `snap` package** is a good option to always have the latest version of the AWS CLI as snap packages automatically refresh. There is no built-in support for selecting minor versions of AWS CLI and therefore is not an optimal install method if your team needs to pin versions.

#### [ Command line installer - Linux x86 (64-bit) ]

To update your current installation of AWS CLI, download a new installer each time you update to overwrite previous versions. Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on Linux.

The following are quick installation steps in a single copy and paste group that provide a basic installation. For guided instructions, see the steps that follow.

**Note**  
**(Optional)** The following command block downloads and installs the AWS CLI without first verifying the integrity of your download. To verify the integrity of your download, use the below step by step instructions.

**To install** the AWS CLI, run the following commands.

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

**To update your current installation** of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command using the `--bin-dir`, `--install-dir`, and `--update` parameters. The following command block uses an example symlink of {{/usr/local/bin}} and example installer location of {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} to install the AWS CLI locally for the current user.

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir {{/usr/local/bin}} --install-dir {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} --update
```

**Guided installation steps**

1. Download the installation file in one of the following ways:
   + **Use the `curl` command** – The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to. The options on the following example command write the downloaded file to the current directory with the local name `awscliv2.zip`. 

     ```
     $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
     ```
   + **Downloading from the URL** – To download the installer with your browser, use the following URL: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip) 

1. **(Optional) Verifying the integrity of your downloaded zip file**

   If you chose to manually download the AWS CLI installer package `.zip` in the above steps, you can use the following steps to verify the signatures by using the `GnuPG` tool.

   The AWS CLI installer package `.zip` files are cryptographically signed using PGP signatures. If there is any damage or alteration of the files, this verification fails and you should not proceed with installation.

   1. Download and install the `gpg` command using your package manager. For more information about `GnuPG`, see the [GnuPG website](https://www.gnupg.org/). 

   1. To create the public key file, create a text file and paste in the following text.

      For reference, the following are the details of the public key.

      ```
      Key ID:           A6310ACC4672475C
      Type:             RSA
      Size:             4096/4096
      Created:          2019-09-18

      Key fingerprint:  FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511  ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C
      ```

   1. Import the AWS CLI public key with the following command, substituting {{public-key-file-name}} with the file name of the public key you created.

      ```
      $ gpg --import {{public-key-file-name}}
      gpg: /home/{{username}}/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
      gpg: key A6310ACC4672475C: public key "AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>" imported
      gpg: Total number processed: 1
      gpg:               imported: 1
      ```

   1. Download the AWS CLI signature file for the package you downloaded. It has the same path and name as the `.zip` file it corresponds to, but has the extension `.sig`. In the following examples, we save it to the current directory as a file named `awscliv2.sig`.

      **For the latest version of the AWS CLI,** use the following command block:

      ```
      $ curl -o awscliv2.sig https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip.sig
      ```

   1. Verify the signature, passing both the downloaded `.sig` and `.zip` file names as parameters to the `gpg` command.

      ```
      $ gpg --verify awscliv2.sig awscliv2.zip
      ```

      The output should look similar to the following.

      ```

      ```
**Important**  
The warning in the output is expected and doesn't indicate a problem. It occurs because there isn't a chain of trust between your personal PGP key (if you have one) and the AWS CLI PGP key. For more information, see [Web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

1. Unzip the installer. If your Linux distribution doesn't have a built-in `unzip` command, use an equivalent to unzip it. The following example command unzips the package and creates a directory named `aws` under the current directory.

   ```
   $ unzip awscliv2.zip
   ```
**Note**  
When updating from a previous version, the `unzip` command prompts to overwrite existing files. To skip these prompts, such as with script automation, use the `-u` update flag for `unzip`. This flag automatically updates existing files and creates new ones as needed.  

   ```
   $ unzip -u awscliv2.zip
   ```

1. Run the install program. The installation command uses a file named `install` in the newly unzipped `aws` directory. By default, the files are all installed to `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symbolic link is created in `/usr/local/bin`. The command includes `sudo` to grant write permissions to those directories. 

   ```
   $ sudo ./aws/install
   ```

   You can install without `sudo` if you specify directories that you already have write permissions to. Use the following instructions for the `install` command to specify the installation location:
   + Ensure that the paths you provide to the `-i` and `-b` parameters contain no volume name or directory names that contain any space characters or other white space characters. If there is a space, the installation fails.
   + `--install-dir` or `-i` – This option specifies the directory to copy all of the files to.

     The default value is `/usr/local/aws-cli`.
   + `--bin-dir` or `-b` – This option specifies that the main `aws` program in the install directory is symbolically linked to the file `aws` in the specified path. You must have write permissions to the specified directory. Creating a symlink to a directory that is already in your path eliminates the need to add the install directory to the user's `$PATH` variable. 

     The default value is `/usr/local/bin`.

   ```
   $ ./aws/install -i {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} -b {{/usr/local/bin}}
   ```
**Note**  
To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command with the `--update` parameter.  

   ```
   $ sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir {{/usr/local/bin}} --install-dir {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} --update
   ```
To locate the existing symlink and installation directory, use the following steps:  
Use the `which` command to find your symlink. This gives you the path to use with the `--bin-dir` parameter.  

      ```
      $ which aws
      {{/usr/local/bin}}/aws
      ```
Use the `ls` command to find the directory that your symlink points to. This gives you the path to use with the `--install-dir` parameter.  

      ```
      $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> {{/usr/local/aws-cli}}/v2/current/bin/aws
      ```

1. Confirm the installation with the following command. 

   ```
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.10.205-195.807.amzn2.x86_64
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

   You can install without `sudo` if you specify directories that you already have write permissions to. Use the following instructions for the `install` command to specify the installation location:
   + Ensure that the paths you provide to the `-i` and `-b` parameters contain no volume name or directory names that contain any space characters or other white space characters. If there is a space, the installation fails.
   + `--install-dir` or `-i` – This option specifies the directory to copy all of the files to.

     The default value is `/usr/local/aws-cli`.
   + `--bin-dir` or `-b` – This option specifies that the main `aws` program in the install directory is symbolically linked to the file `aws` in the specified path. You must have write permissions to the specified directory. Creating a symlink to a directory that is already in your path eliminates the need to add the install directory to the user's `$PATH` variable. 

     The default value is `/usr/local/bin`.

   ```
   $ ./aws/install -i {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} -b {{/usr/local/bin}}
   ```
**Note**  
To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command with the `--update` parameter.  

   ```
   $ sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir {{/usr/local/bin}} --install-dir {{/usr/local/aws-cli}} --update
   ```
To locate the existing symlink and installation directory, use the following steps:  
Use the `which` command to find your symlink. This gives you the path to use with the `--bin-dir` parameter.  

      ```
      $ which aws
      {{/usr/local/bin}}/aws
      ```
Use the `ls` command to find the directory that your symlink points to. This gives you the path to use with the `--install-dir` parameter.  

      ```
      $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> {{/usr/local/aws-cli}}/v2/current/bin/aws
      ```

1. Confirm the installation with the following command. 

   ```
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.10.205-195.807.amzn2.x86_64
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

#### [ Snap package ]

We provide an official AWS supported version of the AWS CLI on `snap`. If you want to always have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed on your system, a snap package provides this for you as it auto-updates. There is no built-in support for selecting minor versions of AWS CLI and therefore it is not an optimal install method if your team needs to pin versions. If you want to install a specific minor version of the AWS CLI, we suggest you use the command line installer.

1. If your Linux platform does not already have `snap` installed, install `snap` on your platform. 

   1. For information on installing `snap`, see [Installing the daemon](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) in the *Snap documentation*.

   1. You may need to restart your system so that your `PATH` variables are updated correctly. If you are having installation issues, follow steps in [Fix common issues](https://snapcraft.io/docs/fix-common-issues) in the *Snap documentation*.

   1. To verify that `snap` is installed correctly, run the following command.

      ```
      $ snap version
      ```

1. Run the following `snap install` command for the AWS CLI.

   ```
   $ snap install aws-cli --classic
   ```

   Depending on your permissions, you may need to add `sudo` to the command.

   ```
   $ sudo snap install aws-cli --classic
   ```
**Note**  
To view the snap repository for the AWS CLI, including additional `snap` instructions, see the [https://snapcraft.io/aws-cli](https://snapcraft.io/aws-cli) page in the *Canonical Snapcraft website*.

1. Verify that the AWS CLI installed correctly.

   ```
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.10.205-195.807.amzn2.x86_64
   ```

   If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

### macOS
<a name="install-macos"></a>

#### Install and update requirements
<a name="install-macos-prereqs"></a>
+ We support the AWS CLI on macOS versions 11 and later. For more information, see [macOS support policy updates for the AWS CLI v2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/macos-support-policy-updates-for-the-aws-cli-v2/) on the *AWS Developer Tools Blog*.
+ Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories, we can’t guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.

**macOS version support matrix**


| AWS CLI version | Supported macOS version | 
| --- | --- | 
| 2.21.0 – current | 11\+ | 
| 2.17.0 –2.20.0 | 10.15\+ | 
| 2.0.0 – 2.16.12 | 10.14 and below | 

#### Install or update the AWS CLI
<a name="install-macos0-instructions"></a>

If you are updating to the latest version, use the same installation method that you used in your current version. You can install the AWS CLI on macOS in the following ways.

------
#### [ GUI installer ]

The following steps show how to install the latest version of the AWS CLI by using the standard macOS user interface and your browser.

1. In your browser, download the macOS `pkg` file: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg) 

1. Run your downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. You can choose to install the AWS CLI in the following ways:
   + **For all users on the computer (requires `sudo`)**
     + You can install to any folder, or choose the recommended default folder of `/usr/local/aws-cli`.
     + The installer automatically creates a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/aws` that links to the main program in the installation folder you chose.
   + **For only the current user (doesn't require `sudo`)**
     + You can install to any folder to which you have write permission.
     + Due to standard user permissions, after the installer finishes, you must manually create a symlink file in your `$PATH` that points to the `aws` and `aws_completer` programs by using the following commands at the command prompt. The default location for a symlink is `/usr/local/bin/`:

       ```
       $ ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws
       $ ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws_completer /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws_completer
       ```

        If you don't have write permissions to the folder, you may need to use `sudo` in your command. The following example uses `sudo` with the default location for a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/`:

       ```
       $ sudo ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws
       $ sudo ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws_completer /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws_completer
       ```
**Note**  
You can view debug logs for the installation by pressing **Cmd\+L** anywhere in the installer. This opens a log pane that enables you to filter and save the log. The log file is also automatically saved to `/var/log/install.log`.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.3.0
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

------
#### [ Command line installer - All users ]

If you have `sudo` permissions, you can install the AWS CLI for all users on the computer. We provide the steps in one easy to copy and paste group. See the descriptions of each line in the following steps. 

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
$ sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

**Guided installation instructions**

1. Download the file using the `curl` command. The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to. In this example, the file is written to `AWSCLIV2.pkg` in the current folder.

   ```
   $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   ```

1. Run the standard macOS `installer` program, specifying the downloaded `.pkg` file as the source. Use the `-pkg` parameter to specify the name of the package to install, and the `-target /` parameter for which drive to install the package to. The files are installed to `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symlink is automatically created in `/usr/local/bin`. You must include `sudo` on the command to grant write permissions to those folders. 

   ```
   $ sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
   ```

   After installation is complete, debug logs are written to `/var/log/install.log`.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.3.0
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

------
#### [ Command line - Current user ]

1. To specify which folder the AWS CLI is installed to, you must create an XML file with any file name. This file is an XML-formatted file that looks like the following example. Leave all values as shown, except you must replace the path {{/Users/myusername}} in line 9 with the path to the folder you want the AWS CLI installed to. *The folder must already exist, or the command fails.* The following XML example, named {{choices.xml}}, specifies the installer to install the AWS CLI in the folder `/Users/myusername`, where it creates a folder named `aws-cli`.

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <array>
       <dict>
         <key>choiceAttribute</key>
         <string>customLocation</string>
         <key>attributeSetting</key>
         <string>{{/Users/myusername}}</string>
         <key>choiceIdentifier</key>
         <string>default</string>
       </dict>
     </array>
   </plist>
   ```

1. Download the `pkg` installer using the `curl` command. The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to. In this example, the file is written to `AWSCLIV2.pkg` in the current folder.

   ```
   $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   ```

1. Run the standard macOS `installer` program with the following options:
   + Specify the name of the package to install by using the `-pkg` parameter.
   + Specify installing to a *current user only* by setting the `-target` parameter to `CurrentUserHomeDirectory`.
   + Specify the path (relative to the current folder) and name of the XML file that you created in the `-applyChoiceChangesXML` parameter.

   The following example installs the AWS CLI in the folder `/Users/myusername/aws-cli`.

   ```
   $ installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg \
               -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory \
               -applyChoiceChangesXML {{choices.xml}}
   ```

1. Because standard user permissions typically don't allow writing to folders in your `$PATH`, the installer in this mode doesn't try to add the symlinks to the `aws` and `aws_completer` programs. For the AWS CLI to run correctly, you must manually create the symlinks after the installer finishes. If your `$PATH` includes a folder you can write to and you specify the folder as the target's path, you can run the following command without `sudo`. If you don't have a writable folder in your `$PATH`, you must use `sudo` for permissions to write to the specified target folder. The default location for a symlink is `/usr/local/bin/`. Replace `folder/installed` with the path to your AWS CLI installation.

   ```
   $ sudo ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws
   $ sudo ln -s /{{folder/installed}}/aws-cli/aws_completer /{{usr/local/bin}}/aws_completer
   ```

   After installation is complete, debug logs are written to `/var/log/install.log`.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.3.0
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).

### Windows
<a name="install-windows"></a>

#### Install and update requirements
<a name="install-windows-prereqs"></a>
+ We support the AWS CLI on Microsoft-supported versions of 64-bit Windows.
+ Admin rights to install software

#### Install or update the AWS CLI
<a name="install-windows-instructions"></a>

To update your current installation of AWS CLI on Windows, download a new installer each time you update to overwrite previous versions. AWS CLI is updated regularly. To see the latest version, see the [AWS CLI version 2 Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst) on *GitHub*. 

1. Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):

   [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi) 

   Alternatively, you can run the `msiexec` command to run the MSI installer.

   ```
   C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
   ```

   For various parameters that can be used with `msiexec`, see [msiexec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec) on the *Microsoft Docs* website. For example, you can use the `/qn` flag for a silent installation.

   ```
   C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi {{/qn}}
   ```

1. To confirm the installation, open the **Start** menu, search for `cmd` to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the `aws --version` command. 

   ```
   C:\> aws --version
   aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
   ```

   If Windows is unable to find the program, you might need to close and reopen the command prompt window to refresh the path, or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md).
